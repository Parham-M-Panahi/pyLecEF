# In the examples we saw a merge function
# now try to implement merge sort
# if you don't know the algorithm, do a google search,
# it's also useful to look up, recursive functions.
# bonus : try to do the merge step in O(n) time,
# so the time complexity of the sort becomes the famous O(n.lgn).

# assume data is a list of numbers.
def merge_sort(data):
  # TODO: code goes here
  return

# for the merging process you can create another function




def main():
  # Be sure to test your code here
  # call it a few time on different lists, and print the result.
  # GOOD LUCK
